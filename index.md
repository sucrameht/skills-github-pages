# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm just starting out in tech and learning things as I go â€” whether it's coding, building apps, or figuring out how everything fits together. This blog is mostly for sharing stuff Iâ€™m working on, things I find interesting, and maybe even some fails along the way.

If youâ€™re also figuring things out, youâ€™re not alone. Thanks for stopping by!

Cheers,

Marcus
